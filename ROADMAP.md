# Roadmap
The document is meant to provide transparency in what is planned for this Koop provider.

## v1.0.0 - Planned July 2015
### Changes 
* Convert to Standard JS for style and structure
* Convert tests from mocha to tape/tap
* Refactor model/agol.js to remove non-koop specific logic for feature service data
  - a few new npm modules should be created around agol item interaction and featureserver scraping
